## Problem Statement
* While customers want to experience a product in-store and then take the final call, it happens quite often that the product they found on the website is not available on the store, especially if the products are huge like cars. 
* This leads to Buyer switching to a different store/brand or Buyer changes his/her mind to buy that product itself.
* Ultimately, the brand often loses a customer and a significant reduction is seen in the sales.

## About the Project
* It's a immersive VR application solution to drive the customers to the offline stores and prevents them from changing their mind to buy the product.
* In case of unavailability of the product, customers would be able to have an immersive experience using VR headsets, which is not possible online, owing to cost of buying a headset. This would prevent the customer from changing his/her mood and ensure customer retention.
